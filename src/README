some common code style:
- postfix:
    - *_t: is type
    - *_a: is ngx_array_t
    - *_s: is ngx_str_t

- prefix:
    - i_*: is input param
    - o_*: is output param
    - io_*: is in&out param

NOTE:

* and the ngx_str_t is DESIGNED to use ngx_str_t.len to test the EOS right?
  so I didn't put `\0' when not need, but pcre_compile need a '\0'.
  refer to json's jsonstr2ngxstr function please. sorry I mess up.
